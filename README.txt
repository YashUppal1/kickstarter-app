This is a web app that is built with the aim to solve the fraud issues with crowdfunding platforms like Indiegogo and Kickstarter.

Problem:
People create projects and ask for crowdfunding to build that project and provide the backers with something in return.
But some people take unfair advantage and create fake products and companies to steal money from people and not to develop their project.

Solution:
This app works with blockchain and runs on Ethereum. Every transaction that happens will be transparent to everyone.
Plus, the funds are not released all at once. The manager creates a fund release request for x amount of money to be paid to y person for z purpose.
This request needs to be approved by more than 50% of backers for it to be approved and funds to be released to the account of y person and not the manager himself.
This way, people are now directly involved in the working of the company in a way and have more transparency of their investment being used properly.
